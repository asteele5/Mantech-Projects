# Mantech Projects
These are the write ups and scripts for 3 projects I completed during my internship at Mantech. Below are brief descriptions of the projects, to see more please view the README inside the project folder. All data from the projects has been removed.

## Signal Parser
In this project I was given a users Signal Messenger data and tasked with decrypting their messages. I used Python with SQLCipher to decrypt and parse the encrypted message data, and displayed the messages in an iMessage format using HTML/CSS.

## File Format Reverse Engineering
I completed 3 levels in this project, where in each level I was given a file of unknown format and used tools such as hex editors to discover the file type and decrypt the data. I then automated the decryption process using Python.

## Group Project
This was a group Capture The Flag (CTF) competition, where we competed against other interns to find 6 hidden keys within a filesystem. My team and I collaborated while leveraging tools such as Wireshark, Ghidra, Autopsy to find the hidden keys.
